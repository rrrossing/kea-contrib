# kea-contrib
Kea files that are contributed and maintained by the Kea community.

## Info

This repository is a place for storing content contributed by the Kea
community that ISC decided to not include in the main Kea repository.

There may be multiple reasons why ISC decides to put contributed
content here rather than in the main Kea repository. For example, 
Linux distribution-specific scripts may be similar between distributions, 
but may vary a bit. Users of distribution A may prefer the script to look 
differently than users of distribution B. Note there is no right or wrong 
way here. Nevertheless ISC could get an endless stream of patches changing 
the script back and forth and this is something we'd like to avoid. Also, 
ISC prefers to work on the Kea code that could benefit all users, regardless 
of which OS or distribution they use.

ISC will probably also put patches that ISC has no way of checking or 
maintaining here. We prefer to keep such changes in the Kea contrib 
repository rather than in main Kea repo.
